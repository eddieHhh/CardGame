## Simple 21-Card Game

# Overview
This Simple 21 Card Game is a browser-based card game, a simplified version of the classic Blackjack game. In this game, the player competes against three computer-controlled players, aiming to achieve a score as close to 21 as possible without going over.

# Game Rules
  # Objective: The goal is to achieve a score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player with the highest score under or equal to 21 wins the game.
  Card Values: Cards are worth their face value, with face cards (Jack, Queen, King) worth 10 and an Ace worth 1 point.
  # Game Play:
  Each player, including the computer-controlled players, starts with one hidden card and one visible card.
  Players take turns to either take a new card or pass.
  The human player can continue taking cards to add to their total score.
  Computer players will automatically take a new card if their total score (including hidden and visible cards) is below 16 and will pass if their score is 16 or       above.
  #Ending the Game:
  If a player's total score exceeds 21, they are 'busted' and out of the game.
  The game ends when all players have passed, or their scores have exceeded 21.
  The player with the highest total score under or equal to 21 is declared the winner.
  How to Play

  scores.
